  RoPE implementation with betweenness-based positional adjustments.
  
  This approach measures the 'betweenness' of each token in continuous semantic space using geometric path comparisons to define betweennes
  and applying these relationships to adjust the underlying rotary embeddings, allowing the model to  develop a more interconnected understanding of token 
  relationships.

  Semantic-Geometric Position Adjustment, Path Comparison Method, Fractional Position Interpolation.
